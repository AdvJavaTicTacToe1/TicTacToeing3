Project Name: TicTacToeing3.
Class: Advanced Java.
Date: May 3, 2024.
Description: Same as the first tic-tac-toe version, except this current one now has a robot playing against you, along with the original features as well. It also has a new hard difficulty.
Partners & Info: My partner was Shawn on this one. I fixed the title screen, added navigation buttons, and also renovated some GUI. I additionally added a single player option too.
